streamlit run C:\Users\csmith.rhs\PycharmProjects\pythonWeb Applications\stocks_vs_indexfunds_project.py [ARGUMENTS]
The python file will be uploaded to your machine under your file name. Upload this to your Command Prompt with quotations around the directory like so, streamlit run "C:\Users\csmith.rhs\PycharmProjects\pythonWeb Applications\stocks_vs_indexfunds_project.py". It will open the project in Streamlit, which is a great interactive platform.

Once you are on Streamlit you will view the different values for the stocks and funds and be able to choose between different stocks and funds to see the return rate between the funds. Finally, you will view a volume histogram to see the differences between the volumes.
